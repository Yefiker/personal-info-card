        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello, this is my second project about <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b>.
          Even if this languages feel hard they are cool. To be honest I really
          like creating things specially now a days everything are indeed need
          technology understanding and I really hate this premium thing so I
          always says I need to create my own
          <strong>Artefical Intellegince(AI)</strong>. But the question is
          &ldca;<b>HOW</b>&rdquo;. One thing I can say is I will try . That is
          the energy.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I say this things don't think me that I am good at coding. But
          the thing is I am working on that. Also I am not like other Like who
          spent 5 hour at coding . You might see me doing other hobbies like
          dancing, cooking,cleaning, taking care of my slef many things.
